Would like to see Ergon, Inc. change its CEO and provide employees with a plan for their futures that everyone can get behind and pull in the same direction.  We need to ID our core-competencies as in a way that opens everyone's eyes on a high level litmus test as to what kinds of business expansions in the future best suit what Ergon assets, Core Competencies and people do best.  We need to ""soul search"" and identify who we are, what we're best at and how we continue to grow.

Many employees with young children, like myself, have had entire years where all of my vacation time has gone to Doctor appointments and sick days for my children. I know it is not the company's problem, but it certainly isn't beneficial to the company to have an employee who hasn't had any meaningful time off in multiple years. Employees in these situations are likely to become resentful because of a feeling that their life has become nothing but work. Unfair as that resent is, it can happen.   I would think that a simple 5 Day Sick Leave per year plan, that can be used to the employee's benefit on the first day of having been gone from work, would be plenty. Also, I would recommend that these days not roll over, and not pay out unless necessary. Additionally, enforce a strict rule that if more than one day is used in succession, the employee must provide a Doctor's note to return to work. This would help prevent abuse of this generous leave program."

R_Kt6KFHkcG,8,Ergon,2019,September,Less than a year,Generation Y (born between 1981 - 2000),Operations,US - West/Southwest,Crafco,NA,"As a growing company we should begin changing over what packaging materials we use to wrap our pallets so that they may be a recyclable material rather than just wasted plastic that gets thrown away.  As for operations, with the new OMS system coming into play, it takes away our ability to entice new customers to either buy certain products or more of what they actually need. When the new system comes into action, it'll require any pricing to be done by quote and I can understand why you would want this done for control purposes. But when doing this, there are quite a few clients that come in and want info and product fast and once we mention getting them a quote they tell us, ""No, that's alright, I'll figure something else out.""  But if we train every level of operations for what margins need to stay above then for anything small quantity or single buy items (floor equipment, small jobs), we should be able to do an instore quote to entice the potential customer and get there business to remain here rather than tell them retail is all we can do without a quote. When doing this it provides more opportunity to sell more equipment, tools, material in conjunction with each other and get more profit over all then maybe getting one or two things sold and having things sit in inventory. This also allows the potential small job clients to upscale their business and when doing so they will continue to come back to us for all their needs. If trained properly, we could ensure quantity and profits rise."

Mississippi gets a bad rap for a lot of reasons.  I think businesses such as Ergon can help provide more for the community which would bring people to our area and keep those graduates from Millsaps, Belhaven, JSU, Hinds. etc. from leaving our state to find a city with more to offer.

To be more specific, rather than have separate organizations which develop and market products in the same industry we should evaluate the overlap between product systems between companies so that the entire organization can be most effective in selling the right product systems for the end customer. In certain cases we are using resources to develop certain systems which could in certain ways compete with systems of sister companies. The result of which is wasted development resources and competition between our organizations. Often times, sales and marketing doesn't fully understand the features and benefits of product systems of sister companies. This means on occasion we are selling against each other which is counter productive. We should find a way to which allows sales and marketing to fully understand the features and benefits of the systems of our sister companies. This will ensure that our marketing and sales efforts are synergized and the customers are offered the correct system for their needs which provides the most net benefit to them."

This compensation is likely to motivate them to continue to improve their skills and become more productive and make them feel appreciated by the company. Under performing employees should be informed of their failure to meet expectations and given incentive to improve their work performance by clearly explaining how their salary/wage is affected.

We work a 12 hour shift and our vacation/sick/grievance time is based off workers who work 8 hour shifts. So 3 days of time off for them is only equivalent to two for us. So if we lose a parent/child/ or whatever we have to take vacation time to cover our days off. It's absolutely absurd. If we take a weeks vacation we have to take 48 hours to get one week off. If we want a holiday off we have to burn an entire weeks vacation for one day when maintenance and other hourly employees can take one day off through the week without being punished.

While the primary intent of these systems may be to increase effectiveness of a small group or an individual, without greater awareness of those in the rest of the company, the true potential is unable to be reached. Outreach within the company on what each group does and how they interact would allow everyone to become more effective in their respective positions.

It is long overdue for MCC to do away with our antiquated practices as far as people management is concerned. Taleo is a GREAT tool, but it is meaningless if we do not have an expectation for managers to follow manage in a way that complements the intent of Taleo, training to help them meet the expectation, and accountability by administrators. (These are minimum expectations, since MCC does not *currently* use Taleo  as a method to offer performance-based raises, which I noticed was one of the Likert questions...). Accountability is lacking across the board (defined as both timely feedback about poor performance and timely praise for strong performance). Generationally speaking, we will continue to lose young(ish) talent if MCC does not transition to a strengths- and growth-based management approach. As an institution of higher education, we need to double-down on a commitment to continued learning and adjust our management practices to align with modern trends.

Referring to the first question,  I would say that everyone that does not recommend MCC needs a change in focus. I have been at MCC a short time and I see some issues but I also see the positives. When interacting with the public and colleagues I want to talk about the great programs, student success stories, opportunities, good things MCC is doing for the community and I want to hear about the hidden gems, the good news across the district that don't get wide publicity. We are all working hard and hearing about the successes at the various campuses serves to uplift spirits and motivate each other. 

The good old days weren't that great - I'm sure there were people grumbling about change even then. 

What's the mission? Preparing students, serving communities, creating opportunities.  I'm on board! Even if my part if advancing the mission is small, I see the value in what I do to prepare students, service communities and create opportunities. I provide administrative support but even if I was mopping floors, I would take pride in providing a clean and welcoming environment for students to learn. 

Please know that I am not the most effusive or demonstrative person but I am passionate in helping students in any capacity and I think MCC is uniquely positioned to make a huge difference for many first generation students in the surrounding counties.

People pay their taxes to support a ""non-for-profit college district"" which now has been turned into the instrument to take money from the public and turn it over to for profit companies with, perhaps, connections to the current board members.
Nothing has demoralized people who work at MCC more than seeing our most vulnerable employees fired and replaced by what looks like temporary workers.

If the whole picture was presented then communication could flow both ways to create compromise and understanding. For example, the students wanted more virtual classes this Fall, but the decision was made that we would not offer the classes in the preferred format once a set number of courses were filled. The past year proved to some students they could achieve their goals virtually, but now we have limited their flexibility. If our goal is to prepare students and create opportunities MCC certainly failed these students. Additionally, there were several efficiencies that staff implemented during the past year that have been either removed or minimized impacting both the students and employees. MCC leadership seems to be stuck holding onto a services model that may not have a successful future.

Our students need more resources, more access to counselors and community resources, and they need more learning-based resources through academic support services. More funds need to be given to our learning centers and student success centers, and we need to properly staff all of them in order to be able to better research and develop learning support to our students. We also need to better supplement the classroom experience by offering faculty the tools of embedded tutoring, supplemental instruction, and learning teams/study groups.
